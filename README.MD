# EPUB TO MOBI CONVERTER BAT

A very simple .bat file that converts.ePub's to .MOBI's. I've also made a custom AHK script that is COMPLETELY OPTIONAL. Read about what the AHK script does further down.

## Installation

Download [The Latest KindleGen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211) to your ePub/Ebook/Convert folder.

Tip: After extracting you can delete all files that came with the kindlegen dl besides the .exe since none the exe doesn't have any dependencies.

## AHK

My AHK Script

Use is just to unzip and type a password in to the ZIP file if it requests it (in the AHK you can disable the password type). This is just a personal one that I run in tandem with a simple [Elgato Stream Deck Multi Action](https://imgur.com/a/vK6HyEE). Dont expect a GUI or anything like that. Included this incase anyone else was using a Stream Deck and was already wanting to automate the unzip.

## Main Contributors - Original Form Post
- [Doitsu](http://www.mobileread.mobi/forums/showthread.php?t=216773) - Original poster from 2013 who made the .bat. I just wanted to put this up to GitHub to help people find it. Wanted to also include my AHK encase anyone else was wanting to automate mass unzipping and then conversion to Mobi.

## Legal Side

Wanted to state that this is just a simple bat that I found online that I've been using for a while now. I spent around an hour or so automating and then documenting some stuff with it and wanted to share it. I mean no copyright infringement or anything like that. This is just a fun repo that will most likely be abandoned after its up since there isn't any need to update it.

TLDR: Please dont sue me, instead just message me on GitHub. Thanks!
